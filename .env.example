# 0G Agent Shield Configuration
# ================================

# Your wallet private key (WITHOUT 0x prefix)
# This key is used for 0G Storage transactions AND as the seed for vault encryption.
# The agent never sees this key — it only accesses decrypted data in-memory.
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# 0G Network RPCs
# Testnet (default for development)
EVM_RPC=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
INDEXER_RPC=https://indexer-storage-testnet-turbo.0g.ai

# Mainnet (uncomment for production)
# EVM_RPC=https://evmrpc.0g.ai
# INDEXER_RPC=https://indexer-storage.0g.ai

# Optional: Override vault encryption passphrase
# If not set, derived from PRIVATE_KEY (recommended)
# VAULT_SECRET=your_custom_passphrase

# Optional: Flow contract address (usually auto-detected by SDK)
# FLOW_ADDR=0x0460aA47b41a66694c0a73f66d5dbc435e006658
