# Auto Commit & Push

After every code change you make, **immediately** commit and push it. Never wait for the user to ask.

## Workflow

1. Stage all changed files with `git add -A`
2. Write a **detailed** commit message (see format below)
3. Commit, then push to the current remote branch

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

What changed:
- bullet list of every file touched and what was modified

Why:
- the motivation / user request behind the change

Risk notes:
- anything that could break, or "None" if safe
```

### Type values

| Type       | Use when                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | new feature or capability             |
| `fix`      | bug fix                               |
| `refactor` | restructuring without behavior change |
| `style`    | formatting, UI, CSS-only changes      |
| `chore`    | deps, config, tooling                 |
| `docs`     | documentation only                    |
| `test`     | adding or updating tests              |

### Scope

Use the top-level directory or component name, e.g. `ui`, `api`, `config`, `cold-open`.

## Rules

- One commit per logical change — don't batch unrelated work
- Never use generic messages like "update files" or "fix stuff"
- If a push fails (e.g. no remote, auth error), report the error to the user and still commit locally
- Never force-push unless explicitly asked
